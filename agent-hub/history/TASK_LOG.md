## Session 2026-06-04

**Agent:** Replit Agent (main branch)
**Objective:** Fix all critical bugs, verify Oracle live, add debug diagnostics screen

### Oracle verification
- Server confirmed live at 92.4.95.252 — Flask v3.0.0, supervisord
- 24 titles available, 3 subscription plans (Basic PKR149 / Standard PKR249 / Premium PKR399)
- XOR encoding confirmed active on all `/api/*` routes
- Auth, catalog, plans API all responding correctly after padding fix

### Bugs fixed
- **BUG-C01 through BUG-C05** — root cause: XOR base64 padding strip
  - File: `raddflix_flutter/lib/core/security/request_encoder.dart`
  - Fix: `final pad = (4 - b64.length % 4) % 4; b64 += '=' * pad;`
- **BUG-P01** — VideoController black screen
  - File: `raddflix_flutter/lib/screens/player_screen.dart`
  - Fix: removed `androidAttachSurfaceAfterVideoParameters: true`
- **BUG-D01** — api_client type error on XOR response
  - File: `raddflix_flutter/lib/core/api/api_client.dart`
  - Fix: type guard `data is String ? jsonDecode(data) : data`
- **BUG-S01** — catalog blank after sync failure
  - File: `raddflix_flutter/lib/providers/catalog_provider.dart`
  - Fix: `await loadFromDb()` in sync exception handler

### New files added
- `raddflix_flutter/lib/screens/debug_diagnostics_screen.dart`
  — Debug-only screen (kDebugMode-gated, absent from release APK)
  — Tab 1: 6 live checks (Oracle, XOR, DB, Auth, Sync, Device ID) with Copy Report
  — Tab 2: Live logcat viewer — color-coded, filterable, auto-scroll, share button
  — Entry: 7-tap on version text in ProfileScreen

### Documentation added
- `README.md` — updated with quick-links and architecture summary
- `AGENT_HANDOFF.md` — comprehensive agent onboarding document
- `ONBOARDING.md` — 4-step quick start for new agents
- `.agents/tasks/BUG_TRACKER.md` — all bugs with root causes
- `.agents/PROJECT_RULES.md` — 10 non-negotiable rules
- `AGENT_PROMPT.md` — universal copy-paste prompt for new Replit agents

### State at end of session
- No known open bugs
- All .MD documentation committed to GitHub main branch
- Debug screen reachable via 7-tap on version in Profile (debug APKs only)

## Session 2026-06-03

**Agent:** Previous agent
**Objective:** Initial bug discovery and triage

### Work done
- Discovered all 30 bugs across server and Flutter client
- Traced XOR encoding issues to single root cause (padding strip)
- Identified sqflite_sqlcipher version was incorrect in pubspec.yaml (4.0.1 → corrected to 3.1.0+1)
- Documented architecture and file map

### State at end of session
- Bug list complete, no fixes applied yet
- All bugs documented in handoff notes

## Session 2026-06-04 (second session)

**Agent:** Replit Agent (main branch)
**Objective:** Fix three major bugs in new APK — movies unplayable, episodes "link expired", black screen after 2-5s

### Root causes diagnosed

- **Bug 1 (movies no play):** `_playMovie()` correctly shows "Video not available yet" for movies with no file in Oracle `files` table (data gap, not code bug). For movies WITH files, failure falls through to Bug 2 path.
- **Bug 2 (stream link expired):** JazzDrive share tokens in Oracle `files.share_url` expired. All `stream_links` in Oracle DB expired 2 days ago (8h TTL, generated June 2). Flutter was calling JazzDrive API directly with these expired tokens → 401 Unauthorized → "Stream link expired" snackbar.
- **Bug 3 (black screen 2-5s):** `VideoController(_player)` created with no config, defaulting to `androidAttachSurfaceAfterVideoParameters: true` — causes surface detach/reattach cycle → blank screen on Android.

### Fixes applied

- **Bug 2 → Step 3b replacement** (`player_screen.dart`): Old code retried JazzDrive with a fresh `share_url` from Oracle (which was also expired). New code calls Oracle's `/api/catalog/play?file_id=<id>` endpoint instead — Oracle has its own JazzDrive session and generates a fresh CDN URL server-side.
- **Bug 1 → Step 2.5 added** (`player_screen.dart`): If shareUrl is null after local DB + inline + Oracle `share_url` checks, now tries Oracle direct play endpoint. Handles movies where `share_url` is missing but Oracle can generate a CDN link.
- **Bug 3** (`player_screen.dart`): `VideoController(_player, configuration: const VideoControllerConfiguration(androidAttachSurfaceAfterVideoParameters: false))` — prevents surface detach causing black screen.
- **`catalog_api.dart`**: Added `CatalogApi.getDirectPlayUrl(fileId)` — calls `/api/catalog/play?file_id=$id`, returns `direct_url` from Oracle response.
- **`constants.dart`**: Added `ApiPaths.directPlayUrl(fileId)` → `/api/catalog/play?file_id=$fileId`.

### Files changed
- `raddflix_flutter/lib/screens/player_screen.dart`
- `raddflix_flutter/lib/core/api/catalog_api.dart`
- `raddflix_flutter/lib/core/constants.dart`

### Architecture note
Oracle's `/api/catalog/play` endpoint (added in a previous session, BUG-A35) generates CDN stream links via Oracle's own JazzDrive admin credentials. This is the correct architecture: Oracle holds JazzDrive credentials centrally, Flutter app just fetches CDN URLs from Oracle. No JazzDrive API calls from the client needed.

### State at end of session
- All three critical bugs fixed in code; APK rebuild required
- If Oracle's JazzDrive session is also invalid, the user must refresh JazzDrive account credentials on Oracle (re-login to JazzDrive admin panel)
